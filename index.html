            <h3 class="textstory2">In my first year of high school, I joined the formed scouting club. At that time, I
                felt a bit awkward and didn't know many people in the group. When we gathered for our first scout
                training session, I noticed her, my fellow group member, who had a friendly and enthusiastic smile.
                As we had to work together on various scout activities, she quickly approached me and happily helped me
                understand the scout tasks. We both started talking about our interests and hobbies, and it turned out
                to be a close friend</h3>

            <h3 class="textstory2">During a school competition, I gathered the courage to express my feelings to her.
                The event was filled with excitement and a competitive spirit, but I couldn't focus on anything else but
                her radiant presence.
                After the competition, with my heart pounding, I approached her in a quiet corner of the school
                courtyard. I stumbled over my words at first, but then I took a deep breath and confessed my feelings. I
                told her how her kindness, enthusiasm, and infectious smile had captured my heart since our first
                meeting in the scouting club.</h3>

            <h3 class="textstory2">When we decided to embark on a relationship, we knew that our journey would be filled
                with challenges, especially since we chose different colleges. However, we decided to stay together and
                committed to maintaining our relationship.
                Throughout our college years, we often traveled long distances to visit each other during holidays or
                weekends. We learned to master effective communication and supported each other in our academic
                endeavors. Although distance sometimes separated us, our love grew stronger.</h3>

            <h3 class="textstory2">I decided it was time to take our relationship to the next level. I planned a special
                surprise at our favorite cafe, where we'd shared many fond memories over coffee. With trembling hands, I
                placed a small velvet box in front of her, revealing a glistening engagement ring. Tears welled up in
                her eyes as I expressed my love and desire to spend my life with her. With tears of joy, she said "yes,"
                and the cafe erupted in cheers, becoming the backdrop to one of our most beautiful moments.</h3>
